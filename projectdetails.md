This is an app that lets me list all my favorite songs in one place. 
I usually have a txt file on my desktop to store the name of songs and the artist name whenever i hear something i like on tv or radio. This app would really take care of that messy txt file.

I liked how the app turned out to be as planned on the original wireframe. I wish i had gotten the join to work and the dropdown to for the genres to work as well.
But overall I am glad the fetch started working on heroku after i removed http from the url address.
